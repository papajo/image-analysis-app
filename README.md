Explanation of Changes:
index.html: A new div element with the ID "progress" is added to hold the progress message.
script.js:
document.getElementById('progress'): Gets a reference to the progress div.
progressDiv.innerHTML = 'Analyzing image...';: Sets the content of the progress div to display the "Analyzing image..." message. This is done before the fetch call.
progressDiv.innerHTML = '';: Clears the content of the progress div after the fetch call (in both the try and catch blocks) to hide the message when the analysis is complete or if an error occurs. Also added in reader.onerror.
resultDiv.innerHTML = '';: The previous code in the previous code snippets was clearing the "result" div after showing analysis message.
How to Test:
Save the changes to index.html and script.js.
Make sure your Node.js server is running.
Refresh your browser and upload an image.
You should now see the "Analyzing image..." message appear while the image is being processed and then disappear when the results are displayed (or if an error occurs).
